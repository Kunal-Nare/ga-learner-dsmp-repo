### Project Overview

 The project was about census data analysis i.e. 
1. Education and income of people, who gets the better income, whether education matters alot or not.
2. Avgerage time work calculation of senior citizens
3. Knowing whether the country has more young people or old people etc. 


### Learnings from the project

 I learned few features of Numpy i.e. Array Appending, Array Filtering, Array Slicing, Array Aggregation


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 For analysis for above scope, I used Numpy features of Array Appending, Array Filtering, Array Slicing, Array Aggregation to calculate age of people, avgerage pay for all people whoes education is below 10 and above 10 and avgerage hours works done by senior people in country
