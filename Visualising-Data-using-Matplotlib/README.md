### Project Overview

 This project was about helping Dream Housing Fianance Company in doing Data Visualization through Matplotlib for various cases.


### Learnings from the project

 I learned to plot Bar Chart when user wants to know the insights in either yes or no e.g. count of Loan Status,to plot stack bar when user wants to know whether loan was taken for education or not,  to plot Scatter chart when user wants to know corelation between Loan Amount and Applicant Income and Coapplicant Income, to plot density chart when user wants to know whether education matter for bigger loan amount or not.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 To plot bar or stack bar chart I found out the count of Loan Status either yes or no, and count of loan status against property area, and count of loan status against education. To plot density chart I found out the count of Graduate as qualification and Non Graduate as qualification of education against loan status.To plot scatter chart  using subplot I directly passed the values of Loan Amount against Applicant/Coapplicant Income.
